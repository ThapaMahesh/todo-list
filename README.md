# Developer test

Implementation of a simple To-Do list as a web application, using HTML5 on the frontend and any technology on the backend side. The application allows you to add, view and mark as done various tasks. For backend - write a simple API script in PHP, NodeJS or any other language. 

## Functionality 
The application displays a list of tasks to be performed. Tasks are divided into *done* and *to be done*.
  - Tasks *done* are crossed out and are marked in color (`#9eb2c0`) and the check box on the left is marked.
  - Tasks *to-do* are marked with a color (`#2e3641`) and an unchecked check box on the left. 
  - A field with the possibility of adding a new task is always displayed under the task list. The new task is always *to-do*.
  - After adding a new task, it is added above the field for adding a new task. A field with the option of adding a new task is always at the very bottom of the list.
  - You cannot add a task without entering the title (validation should be on the `frontend` and` backend` sides).
  - Each task can be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon.
  - You can change order of tasks by moving them with *drag & drop*.
